🎓 AI-Powered Personalized Education Platform

> “Imagine having a patient tutor, a visual note-taker, and a quizmaster — all in one place.”

This project is a next-gen learning assistant built with AI, designed to help students understand topics faster, visually map out ideas, and prepare smarter — not harder.

Built for the AI Hackathon under the theme: “Personalized Education”, this app showcases how artificial intelligence can transform the way students learn and revise.

 🚀 What This Project Offers

 🧠 1. AI Tutor Chatbot
Ask anything — from "What is Newton's third law?" to "Explain recursion with an example" — and get instant answers using the OpenAI API.  
✨ Supports voice input too, so students can learn hands-free.

---

 🗺️ 2. Mind Map Generator
Type a topic like “Photosynthesis” or “Cloud Computing” and watch it turn into a visual mind map.  
The app uses AI to generate Mermaid.js diagrams, helping learners break down complex topics into organized subtopics.

---

 📝 3. (Coming Soon) Quiz Generator
Soon, this platform will be able to generate mini quizzes based on the mind map — perfect for self-assessment before exams!

---

 🌐 Live Demo (Optional)

You can run the app locally, or deploy it using [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

📌 Why I Built This
As a student myself, I’ve often wished for smarter tools to help connect concepts, revise visually, and quiz myself interactively. This project is my attempt to create exactly that — not just for me, but for every student out there.
Whether it's preparing for an exam, understanding a tough subject, or just being curious — this app is built to make learning feel less like memorizing, and more like discovering.
